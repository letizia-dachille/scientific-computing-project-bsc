# Scientific Computing Project
Scientific Computing exam project at University of Pisa - Language: Italian. <br>
Title (Italian): <em>Analisi dellâ€™algoritmo Arnoldi-PET per il calcolo del PageRank
</em>. <br>
Title (English): <em>Analysis of Arnoldi-PET algorithm for computing PageRank</em>.

The source code in Matlab can be found in [Code](https://github.com/letizia-dachille/scientific-computing-project-bsc/blob/main/Code/) folder. You must create a folder named <em>Txt</em> in the main folder, where output files will be placed.
Then, it is sufficient to run the file [main_script.m](https://github.com/letizia-dachille/scientific-computing-project-bsc/blob/main/Code/main_script.m).<br>
The datasets used can be found in [Test_matrices](https://github.com/letizia-dachille/scientific-computing-project-bsc/blob/main/Test_matrices/) folder.
